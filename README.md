There are two files for this lab.

1. Start by reading `Lab_03_instructions.pdf`, which describes things you need
to know for this lab (about the R functions for working with the MODTRAN model
and the data that it produces, as well as some useful R functions that we will
use in procesing and graphing data for this lab.)

This file also has the exercises you will do for this lab.

This repository includes both printed instructions 
(`Lab_02_assignment_part_2.pdf`) and a version that you can read online on
GitHub ([`Lab_02_assignment_part_2.md`](Lab_02_assignment_part_2.md)).

These instructions are also identical to the ones posted on the course website
at <https://ees3310.jgilligan.org/lab_docs/lab_03_instructions/>.

2. When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
edit the file `Lab_03_exercises.Rmd` to write your answers and show your
work.

## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github to your
  own computer.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `Lab_03_data_exercises.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

  The last changes that you push before the due date 
  (9:00 AM on Monday Feb. 3) will be graded.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.

I also advise knitting your answers frequently to make sure that they 
knit correctly.

**Remember that to turn in the assignment you need to:**

1. Successfully **knit** `Lab_02_assignment_part_2.Rmd` into a `.pdf` or 
   Word (`.docx`) file. 
2. **Commit** your `.Rmd` (rmarkdown) document **and** the `.pdf` or `.docx` 
   file to your local git repository on your computer.
3. **Push** your local repository to GitHub, so Ms. Best and Prof. Gilligan 
   can see your final results.

**The last version of your work that you have pushed by the deadline is what 
will be graded.**
You will lose a lot of points if there is not a `.pdf` or `.docx` file with 
results.

As long as there is a file with results, we will be generous with partial 
credit.
